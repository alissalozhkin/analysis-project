# analysis-project
A major concern connected to climate change is sea level rise. This project aimed to answer the following research question: “How are global mean sea levels changing with respect to changes in atmospheric CO2concentrations, mean cumulative mass balance of glaciers and global mean temperatures?” 

Statistical measures were used to compare the independent and dependent variables. The pandas python library was used to process the data, and the matplotlib library was used to create curve-fitting algorithms that allowed the user to see the dependent variable against the independent variable against various curve equations (ex. quadratic, cubic). The project presents all these calculations in an interactive program.
