A major concern connected to climate change is sea level rise. We are interested in factors that affect sea level rise, such as glacier melt, ice sheet mass loss, and temperatures rising all over the world. We are interested, additionally, in the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air and sea level rise and whether the two follow similar increasing trends. This project aimed to answer the following research question: “How are global mean sea levels changing with respect to changes in atmospheric CO2concentrations, mean cumulative mass balance of glaciers and global mean temperatures?” 

We used statistical measures to compare the independent and dependent variables. We used the pandas python library to process the data, and the matplotlib library to create curve-fitting algorithms that allowed the user to see the dependent variable against the independent variable against various curve equations (ex. quadratic, cubic). The project presents all these calculations in an interactive program.
